Bulgur Chili
============
I tripled this recipe and made a huge stock pot full of it. My freezer is now happily full of single-serving sized containers of hearty chili.

Ingredients:
============
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 green pepper, diced
* 1 red pepper, diced
* 1 1/2 cups chopped baby bella mushrooms
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp diced jalapeno (or more, if you like your chili spicy)
* 1 tbsp cocoa powder
* 1 28oz can of crushed tomatoes
* 1 can kidney beans, drained
* 1 can great northern beans, drained
* 1/2 cup bulgur
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp chili powder
* paprika (to taste)
* 4 cups vegetable stock (We used Rapunzelâ€™s sea salt & herb boullion instead)

Setup:
======

1. In a large stock pot, heat oil over medium heat.
2. Add onions, garlic, peppers, and jalapeno and saute until they soften.
3. Stir in spices and tomatoes. Continue to cook for 2-3 more minutes.
4. Stir in remaining ingredients (and only 3 cups of broth to begin with) and bring to a boil.
5. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and stir occasionally.
6. If the chili begins to thicken too much, continue to add stock until it reaches a chili-like consistency (the bulgur will soak up a good majority of the liquid.).
7. Let simmer for 45 minutes until the bulgur has softened.

Notes:
======
We ate this with vegan cornbread.
