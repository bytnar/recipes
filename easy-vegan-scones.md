Easy Vegan Raisin Scones
========================

Yield: 16 scones

Ingredients:
============
* 1/2 cup Earth Balance
* 2 cups sifted flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* ¼ cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1/2 cup seedless raisin
* 2 teaspoons of egg replacer
* 4 tablespoons of water
* 3/4 cup Soy Milk 

1. Sort together the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and cinnamon. (You can use a whisk instead of a sifter.)
2. Cut in Earth Balance using a pastry blender or fork until mixture is the consistency of cornmeal.
3. Stir in raisins.
4. Whisk egg replacer and water in a liquid measuring cup.
5. Add enough soy milk to measure 3/4 cup.
6. Blend together.
7. Add all at once to flour mixture.
8. Stir until moist.
9. Sprinkle flour onto pastry cloth.
10. Turn dough over to coat both sides with flour.
11. Knead six times. (I just knead it in the bowl.) 
12. Spread spoonfuls of batter into a round circle 1/4 inch thick on an ungreased cookie sheet.
13. Bake in hot oven 460F, about 15 minutes until golden brown. 
14. Serve hot with earth balance and jam and jelly.

Notes:
======
The vegan scones are more moist, so you really don’t have to knead them, just mix well.
I used vegan chocolate chips instead of raisins, and didn’t put cinnamon in.
