Vegan Chipotle Sausage Carrot Soup
====
**Disclaimer:** I never measure anything making this, so tweak the quantities of everything to adjust the spiciness and density
of this soup as desired.  :)

* Prep time: 10 minutes
* Cook time: 30-45 minutes

## Ingredients:
* 1 tbsp coconut, olive or other oil (chili oil is good if you have it)
* 2-3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 4-pack of Field Roast vegan chipotle sausages, roughly sliced (I even just tear it into pieces)
* ~3-5 medium potatoes, cut into bite-sized cubes
* 5 large carrots or 2 cups of sliced baby carrots
* 1-2 quartz veggie broth
* 1 cup almond or other non-dairy milk (optional)
* 1-3 bay leaves
* 1/2 cup parsley, finely chopped
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 cup nutritional yeast
* 1 package of pasta (I like spiral or bowtie noodles in this)

## Setup:
1. In a large stock pot, add the oil, garlic and sausage and heat over medium heat. Saute for a few minutes.
2. Add in the carrots & potatoes and saute for another minute or so.
3. Add in the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
4. Once boiling, cover with lid and reduce heat to low. Simmer for about 45 minutes until carrots and potatoes are tender and pasta is cooked.
